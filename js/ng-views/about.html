<h2>About Link_to()</h2>
<p class="intro">>Link_to() was built using Ruby on Rails as an API and AngularJS for the front-end.</p>
<p class="intro">>Things the developers are particularly proud of are the attendance model used to get around the traditional user-authentication methods and the overall flow of the app itself.</p>
<p class="intro">>Future iterations of this app would include using MeetUp.com's API to help populate meetup information and integration of the technology "O-Auth" to allow users to sign in using either GitHub or Linked in accounts to help with profile building and networking.</p>
